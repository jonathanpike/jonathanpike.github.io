## Experience
<div>
	<h4>Remote Junior Web Developer <span class="pull-right">Nov - Dec 2015</span></h4>
	<p>The Firehose Project</p>

	<p>Worked on a remote team of 5 developers to build a Ruby on Rails chess web application that enforces the rules of chess (e.g. users cannot move themselves into checkmate, support for castling and en passant, etc.). <a href="https://github.com/teamendgame/endgame-chess">View the GitHub repository.</a></p>

	<strong>My Accomplishments:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>I personally built many features on the app, notably the business logic for determining if the game was in the state of check. <a href="https://github.com/teamendgame/endgame-chess/pull/41/files">See the code on GitHub.</a></li>
		<li>Was held accountable for following best practices like test-driven-development, code reviews and pair programming by Travis Johnson, a reliability engineer at <a href="http://zefr.com/">ZEFR</a>, who led the team.</li>
		<li>Uncovered, tracked down and resolved a bug in the turn-based logic of the Chess game. See the code on GitHub.</li>
	</ul>

	<strong>Our Development Workflow:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Had a kick-off meeting to set goals and expectations with various team-members and stakeholders.</li>
		<li>Followed standard Agile and SCRUM methodologies (virtual stand-ups, sprint planning, etc).</li>
		<li>We used Firebase to support the WebSocket layer that allows real-time piece move updates to the game across the two players of the game.</li>
		<li>Used the rubocop gem to enforce team members conform to the ruby style guide.</li>
		<li>Used TravisCI as a platform to run our continuous integration and continuous deployment.</li>
		<li>Pair programmed with other developers using Screenhero.</li>
		<li>Used Trello as an agile board and Slack to ensure great team communication between all developers.</li>
	</ul>

## Education and Professional Development
<div>
	<h4>The Firehose Project <span class="pull-right">Sept - Dec 2015</span></h4>
	<p>In an intensive 15 week program, I learned how to become a capable software developer who is able to break complex problems into more manageable problems. I also learned the following tools of the trade:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Learned how to build-out basic CRUD Rails apps following standard Rails conventions (without using scaffolding), involving mailers, validations, image uploading on AWS S3 and nested RESTful routes.</li>	
		<li>Implemented tests using the MiniTest’s Test::Unit syntax for both unit and functional tests.</li>	
		<li>Worked through traditional computer science algorithms and data structures challenges:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Graph search (depth-first & breadth-first).</li>
			<li>Implemented linked lists with basic Ruby classes.</li>
			<li>Implemented stacks and queues in Ruby.</li>
			<li>Reversed linked lists (both with a recursive solution with mutation, and a solution that leverages stack-like properties of linked lists).</li>
			<li>Implemented Floyd’s algorithm (tortoise & hare) to detect cycles within a linked list.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
