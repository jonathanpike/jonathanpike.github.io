## Summary
I'm a programmer by nature; programming excites the problem-solving part of my brain.  My process is to plan before I code, researching best practices and mining the knowledge of those who came before me.  Once the plan is fully formed, I write tests, then solve the problem. Practice refines my current skills and solidifies new ones.  Continuously learning new languages, frameworks, and design patterns makes me more efficient. I love the web and want to make it better by building great things. 

## Experience
<div>

	<strong>My Accomplishments:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Personally built many features of the app, notably the business logic for determining if the game is in the state of check (<a href="https://github.com/teamendgame/endgame-chess/pull/41/files">see the code on GitHub</a>) and checkmate (<a href="https://github.com/teamendgame/endgame-chess/pull/67">see the code on GitHub</a>).</li>
		<li>Uncovered, tracked down, and resolved several bugs in both our Ruby and Javascript code, including an intermittent bug that prevented movement of some pieces.

<div>
	<h4><strong>Programming Bootcamp</strong> <span class="pull-right">Sept - Dec 2015</span></h4>
	<p><span class="highlight">The Firehose Project</span></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Built basic CRUD Rails apps following standard Rails conventions (without using scaffolding), involving mailers, validations, image uploading on AWS S3, and nested RESTful routes.</li>	
		<li>Implemented tests using the Minitest’s Test::Unit syntax for both unit and functional tests.</li>	
		<li>Worked through traditional computer science algorithms and data structure challenges:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Graph search (depth-first & breadth-first).</li>
			<li>Linked lists with basic Ruby classes.</li>
			<li>Stacks and queues in Ruby.</li>
			<li>Reversed linked lists (both with a recursive solution with mutation, and a solution that leverages stack-like properties of linked lists).</li>
			<li>Floyd’s algorithm (tortoise & hare) to detect cycles within a linked list.</li>
		</ul>
