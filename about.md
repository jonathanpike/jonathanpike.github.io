I'm Jonathan Pike, a software developer in Mississauga, Ontario. I seek to deeply understand the programming languages I learn, through both [practice](http://jonathanpike.net/2015/09/26/Always-Be-Coding.html) and [research](http://jonathanpike.net/2015/11/24/Smooth-Ruby-Operators.html). I love the web, open source software, and fixing that one stubborn bug that refuses to be fixed.
