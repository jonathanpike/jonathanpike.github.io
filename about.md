I'm Jonathan Pike, a full-stack web developer (specializing in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)) in Mississauga, Ontario.  I think that code can make the world a better place. 

I started this site to talk about my experience in the [Firehose Project](http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/), which is awesome.  

### Theme

The theme, _Personal Development_, was lovingly crafted by me.  If you want to view the source, please [view it on GitHub](https://github.com/jonathanpike/jonathanpike.net).
