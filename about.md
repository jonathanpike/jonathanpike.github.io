I'm Jonathan Pike, a software developer in Mississauga, Ontario. I seek to deeply understand the programming languages I learn, through both [practice](http://jonathanpike.net/2015/09/26/Always-Be-Coding.html) and [research](http://jonathanpike.net/2015/11/24/Smooth-Ruby-Operators.html). I love the web, open source software, and fixing that one stubborn bug that refuses to be fixed. 

### Theme

The theme, _Personal Development_, was lovingly crafted by me.  If you want to view the source, please [view it on GitHub](https://github.com/jonathanpike/jonathanpike.github.io).
