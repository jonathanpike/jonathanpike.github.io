This is my personal blog.  A few notes: 

## Software

- Static pages generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- Markdown parsing by [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/)

## Theme

I lovingly hand coded the theme, which I call "Personally Developed". You can view its repository [here](https://github.com/jonathanpike/personally-developed).
