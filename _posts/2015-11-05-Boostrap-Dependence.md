The following Tweet from [renowned front end developer, Noah Stokes](http://noahstokes.com/) really caught my eye the other day: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have a Bootstrap Generation of folks coming up who have never learned basic positioning in CSS. Learn the fundamentals first, then a FW.</p>&mdash; Noah Stokes (@motherfuton) <a href="https://twitter.com/motherfuton/status/659044219022012417">October 27, 2015</a></blockquote>

In [the Firehose Project](http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/), one of the major things we learn about front end design is to use the [Bootstrap Framework](http://getbootstrap.com/).  Going into the course, I had heard a little and read a little about Bootstrap, mostly negative.  The main complaints: all Bootstrap websites look the same and that Bootstrap comes with a ton of bloat.  I believed that until I started using Bootstrap, which then lead me to realize that Bootstrap made designing good looking websites incredibly easy.  In fact, I used Bootstrap for this website to help out with the layout.

What Noah had to say really got me thinking, though.  I don’t really know much about CSS positioning, and that’s a problem.  I also didn’t really know where to start looking, so I thought I would ask the master himself: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/jonathanpike">@jonathanpike</a> I sure do :D&#10;&#10;<a href="https://t.co/EMoCkU7YG7">https://t.co/EMoCkU7YG7</a>&#10;&#10;<a href="https://t.co/HvetuXiRAq">https://t.co/HvetuXiRAq</a></p>&mdash; Noah Stokes (@motherfuton) <a href="https://twitter.com/motherfuton/status/659763408749772801">October 29, 2015</a></blockquote>

Aside from the resources from [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/) that Noah linked to, I took it upon myself to research CSS layout and positioning, since it’s really a core competency of a web developer.  I wanted to share a few resources that I found with you that I thought were really great: 

- [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com/): This is a fantastic tutorial that goes over CSS layout fundamentals in an easy-to-digest way.  While there are only 19 “lessons”, there’s a ton to learn (and I learned a ton!). 
- [CSS Tricks Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/): One of the coolest new-_ish_ CSS layout techniques is called Flexbox, and this guide goes deep.  I’ve used Flexbox positioning in a few projects and I can say with certainty that it’s easy to use (and that makes me happy). 
- [What the Flexbox?!](http://flexbox.io/): On the same theme, [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/) put out this great, free video course explaining all sorts of cool Flexbox tricks.  

I still think that Bootstrap is an incredibly useful tool, but the fundamentals are fundamental for a reason.  I think that [this article from H. Alan Stevens](http://halanstevens.com/blog/bootstrap-youre-doing-it-wrong/) does a really great job of explaining what Bootstrap is good for, what it’s not good for, and some best practices for using it.  

In doing my research, I also came across [Pure](http://purecss.io/), a _seriously tiny_ group of CSS components that help with rapid development of responsive web projects from (wait for it…) [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com).  While Pure would obviously be subject to the same criticism that Bootstrap does with not teaching _you_ as a developer how to CSS, it does solve the bloat problem.  Worth checking out!
