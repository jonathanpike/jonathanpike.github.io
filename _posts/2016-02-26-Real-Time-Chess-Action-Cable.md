After having built a [chess appliction](http://endgame-chess.herokuapp.com) with a [real time component](https://pusher.com/), this demo was right up my alley. The abstraction of channels and subscriptions (combined with JavaScript callbacks) will still take some getting used to, but I found the author did a good job of explaining everything in an understandable way. 

After reading [Websockets, caution required!](https://samsaffron.com/archive/2015/12/29/websockets-caution-required) from Sam Saffron, Websockets seem to have a lot of limitations, some of which are addressed by HTTP/2. It will be interesting to see how the real time landscape changes in the next few years.
