I immediately signed up for CloudFlare once I read this post.  It took about 5 minutes to set up, and about 3 hours to propagate through the DNS network.  CloudFlare backed sites also have the benefit of being [served with HTTP/2](https://www.nateberkopec.com/2016/01/07/what-http2-means-for-ruby-developers.html). And did I mention that CloudFlare has a free plan?
