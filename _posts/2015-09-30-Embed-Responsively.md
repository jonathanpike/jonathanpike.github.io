When I posted [the ABCs of Programming](http://jonathanpike.net/2015/09/26/Always-Be-Coding.html) earlier this week, I embedded a video from YouTube. The video looked fine on my iMac, but when I looked at it on my iPhone, it was hideously oversized.  A quick google search lead to this fantastic utility. 

Just paste in the URL and it automatically generates responsive embed codes.  Works with YouTube, Vimeo, Google Maps, Instagram, Vine, and more.

**Update:** I just learned that [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#responsive-embed) already includes responsive embed by default.
