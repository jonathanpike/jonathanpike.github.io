The first programming nearly everyone does is the simple "Hello, world" script. It's instant gratification at its best. Type something into a computer, the computer spits something out. _You're a programmer!_ 

I've come a long way from my "Hello, world" days, but I still learn a ton every day. This blog is my way of showing myself what I've learned. The cliche is that until you can explain a topic to a 10 year old, you don't really know the topic. Consider this blog my explanation, although I doubt if you're a 10 year old. 

I'm currently in my second week of [the Firehose Project](http://www.thefirehoseproject.com) bootcamp, learning [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), algorithms, data structures -- all that I need to know to be a competent beginner programmer. I plan to cover topics that I'm learning as I go through Firehose, as well as anything incedental that I'm learning or thinking about. 

Here's to getting better!
